# 5 AI Mini-Hackathon (25th February 2025)

This is the final event of the semester, where you will have the opportunity to apply your knowledge and skills to solve a real-world problem, of your choice.

This will be a chance for you to explore designing an AI project. No coding experience is required. This will be a very hands-on and practical workshop, showing how to search for data and then plan what experiments you could potentially run.

**Recording**: *To be uploaded after the session*
