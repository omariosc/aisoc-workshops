# 6 AI Project Showcase (29th April 2025)

The final workshop will be a chance for you to present and talk about your work following on from the fifth workshop. Completely optional, you are encouraged to continue working in your groups, and use this workshop as an opportunity to apply what youâ€™ve learnt. Feel free to reach out for any assistance and problems you may face.

Participants of all six workshops (including online workshops) will be presented with an official certificate of attendance upon request. These will be sent out mid-May.

This will be a hybrid workshop, giving all online and in-person participants the opportunity to get involved.
