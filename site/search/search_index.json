Description The goals of the workshops are to: Demystify Artificial Intelligence. Provide a foundation in AI concepts and ethical considerations. Foster problem-solving and critical thinking through real-world applications. Empower students to explore further educational and industrial opportunities in AI. This repository contains all the resources and materials for the workshops that will be held throughout the semester. Each workshop will have its own folder containing the relevant files and instructions. Workshops Workshop 1: Introduction to AI Learn about the fundamentals powering everyday technology, covering the basics of AI & ML, real-world applications and the process from idea inception to deployment. Workshop 2: Building a Machine Learning Pipeline How can we go from real-world data to producing useful predictions? We will start to look at more technical details, including practical coding exercises exploring linear regression, logistic regression and decision trees. Workshop 3: Neural Networks A simple and intuitive way to understand neural networks and their code-based implementations. Workshop 4: Ethics of AI You might think this is boring and want to skip this one out, but it will be the most insightful and thought-provoking session. Workshop 5: AI Mini-Hackathon : The capstone group project is to consolidate learning over all workshops. Workshop 6: AI Project Showcase An opportunity to showcase your work, leading on from the previous hackathon . Booking Tickets Tickets are offered on a first-come-first-serve basis.
